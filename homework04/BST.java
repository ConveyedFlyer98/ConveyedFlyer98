    /**
     * Finds the path between two elements in the tree, specifically the path
     * from data1 to data2, inclusive of both.
     *
     * This must be done recursively.
     * 
     * A good way to start is by finding the deepest common ancestor (DCA) of both data
     * and add it to the list. You will most likely have to split off and
     * traverse the tree for each piece of data adding to the list in such a
     * way that it will return the path in the correct order without requiring any
     * list manipulation later. One way to accomplish this (after adding the DCA
     * to the list) is to then traverse to data1 while adding its ancestors
     * to the front of the list. Finally, traverse to data2 while adding its
     * ancestors to the back of the list. 
     *
     * Please note that there is no relationship between the data parameters 
     * in that they may not belong to the same branch. 
     * 
     * You may only use 1 list instance to complete this method. Think about
     * what type of list to use considering the Big-O efficiency of the list
     * operations.
     *
     * This method only needs to traverse to the deepest common ancestor once.
     * From that node, go to each data in one traversal each. Failure to do
     * so will result in a penalty.
     * 
     * If both data1 and data2 are equal and in the tree, the list should be
     * of size 1 and contain the element from the tree equal to data1 and data2.
     *
     * Ex:
     * Given the following BST composed of Integers
     *              50
     *          /        \

     *    /  \    \
     *   11   15   40
     *  /
     * 10
     * findPathBetween(10, 40) should return the list [10, 11, 12, 25, 37, 40]
     * findPathBetween(50, 37) should return the list [50, 25, 37]
     * findPathBetween(75, 75) should return the list [75]
     *
     * Must be O(log n) for a balanced tree and O(n) for worst case.
